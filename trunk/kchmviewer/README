1. OVERVIEW

  KchmViewer is a chm (MS HTML help file format) viewer, written in C++. Unlike most existing CHM viewers for Unix,
  it uses Trolltech Qt widget library, and does not depend on KDE or Gnome. However, it may be compiled with full 
  KDE support, including KDE widgets and KIO/KHTML. 

  The main advantage of KchmViewer is extended support for non-English languages. Unlike others, KchmViewer in most 
  cases correctly detects chm file encoding, correctly shows tables of context of Russian, Korean, Chinese and 
  Japanese help files, and correctly searches in non-English help files (search for MBCS languages - ja/ko/ch is 
  still in progress). 

  KchmViewer is written by Georgy Yunaev (gyunaev@ulduzsoft.com), and is licensed under GNU GPL license. Please 
  do NOT use this email for bug reporting; see below.

2. FEATURES

  - Standalone viewer, depends on Qt only. Does not require KDE, Gnome or wxWindows toolkit. 
  - A KDE viewer can be compiled optionally, with KIO slave, KHTML and K*Widget support. 
  - Completely safe and harmless. Does not support JavaScript in any way, optionally warns you before opening an 
    external web page, or switching to another help file. 
  - Correctly detects and shows encoding of any valid chm file. 
  - Correctly shows non-English chm files, including cyrillic, chinese, japanese and others. 
  - Correctly searches in non-English chm files using chm built-in search index. 
  - Shows an appropriate image for every TOC entry. 
  - Has complete chm index support, including multiple index entries, cross-links and parent/child entries in index. 
  - Persistent bookmarks support. Allows to store bookmarks even if "Favorites" window was not enabled for this chm 
    file. Also stores the screen position for every bookmark. You can also edit/delete bookmarks. 
  - For any opened chm file, stores the last opened window, search history, bookmark history, font size and so on, so
    when you open this file again, everything is always on the place. 
  - Has easy and powerful search-in-page support. 
  - Allows to increase or decrease the font size, so physically handicapped people can read texts easily. 
  - Has standard Back/Forward/Home navigation. 
  - Can print the opened pages on a standard printer (usually via CUPS). 
  - Has complex search query support. You can use search queries like "lazy people" + learn -not.


3. INSTALLATION

  Usually kchmviewer is distributed in source code archive, so you need to compile it first. It compiles with Qt 3.x,
  but recommended Qt version is 3.3.4 and above. This is due to font resizing bug existing in previous Qt versions,
  so if you use pre-3.3.4, you will have problems with font sizes. Note that you need to install qt3-devel package,
  not only qt package.

3.1. Qt-only version

  To compile Qt-only version of kchmviewer, follow the simple procedure:

  > tar zxf kchmviewer-<version>.tar.gzi
  > cd kchmviewer-<version>
  > ./configure
  > make
  > sudo make install

  The last step is optional; you can use kchmviewer binary without installation.

3.2 KDE version

  This procedure will create the Qt-only executable, which does not use KDE. If you want to compile executable 
  for KDE, add --with-kde to configure options. For KDE version, 'make install' is required to work with KHTML
  browser. Note that you need kdelibs-devel package installed.

  > tar zxf kchmviewer-<version>.tar.gz
  > cd kchmviewer-<version>
  > ./configure --with-kde
  > make
  > sudo make install

3.3 x86-64 version

  To compile kchmviewer version for x86-64, make sure that you have installed 64-bit qt and qt-devel libraries,
  and specify the path to them with --with-qt-libraries= configure switch:

  > tar zxf kchmviewer-<version>.tar.gz
  > cd kchmviewer-<version>
  > ./configure --with-qt-libraries=/usr/lib/qt3/lib64 [--with-kde (optional)]
  > make
  > sudo make install

  If you experience any link error, make sure you have all 64bit libraries installed. Look careful on error
  messages; usually they point you to right direction. 


4. USAGE
 
  Usage of kchmviewer is simple:

  > kchmviewer mychmfile.chm

  for the rest of command-line options, see kchmviewer --help
