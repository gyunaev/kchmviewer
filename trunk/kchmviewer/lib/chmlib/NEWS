Changes from 0.37 to 0.38
    - Fix for reading some chm files.  Running over a large directory of chm
      files, about 1% of them turned out to be unreadable.  This resulted from
      an incomplete understanding of one of the header fields (index_root).
      Apparently, this can take negative values other than -1.

    - Security fix for extract_chmLib.  Pathnames containing a ".." element
      will not be extracted.  There doesn't seem to be a legitimate reason to
      use ".." as a path element in a chm file.

Changes from 0.36 to 0.37
    - Major security fix for stack overflow vulnerability:
        http://www.sven-tantau.de/public_files/chmlib/chmlib_20051126.txt
    - Corrected the broken Makefile.in.

Changes from 0.35 to 0.36
    - Major security fix (iDEFENSE Security Advisory IDEF1099 - Stack Overflow
      Vulnerability)
    - Major security fix from Palasik Sandor (LZX decompression buffer overrun)
    - Bugfix/enhancement from David Huseby to make the "what" flags to
      chm_enumerate work correctly, and to pass the flags along to the callback
      function (via the chmUnitInfo structure) so that the callback doesn't
      need to re-parse the filename.
    - Compilation fixes for x86-64 from Vitaly V. Bursov.
    - Miscellaneous fixes to the configure script, including some significant
      cleanup by Vadim Zeitlin.  The changes from Vadim should also allow the
      configure script to correctly configure the build on OS X, where it was
      previously failing to note that pread64 doesn't work.
    - Minor update to the Makefile.in to do a mkdir before the install, in case
      the specified INSTALLPREFIX directory is non-existent

Changes from 0.32 to 0.35
    - UTF-8 filenames, while still not handled correctly, are handled a little
      more gracefully.  That is to say, the library doesn't fail to open files
      with filenames using characters outside the ASCII subset.  I'm very
      interested in any information as to the "right" way to handle filenames
      of this sort.
    - Files not containing a compressed section are handled properly, such as
      .chw files.  These files seem to contain information about compression,
      but the information is invalid or empty.  The library deals gracefully
      with this now.
    - Files compressed with different options were not being decompressed
      properly.  In particular, if the "reset interval" for the compressed
      section was other than 2 block sizes, it could fail to read some of the
      files.
    - The caching system was improved slightly, in conjunction with this
      previous bugfix.

Changes from 0.3 to 0.32:
    - [Rich Erwin] Minor portability fixes for Windows CE.
    - [Pabs] Minor bugfix regarding detecting directory entries versus empty files.
    - [Antony Dovgal] autoconf-based build process
    - [Ragnar Hojland Espinosa] Feature additions for chm_http:
        * Use SO_REUSEADDR
        * Allow --bind= and --port= command line arguments
    - Simple makefile has been fixed (finally) to use gcc instead of gcc-3.2.  (Sorry, everybody!)

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3:

    - initial attempt at portability to Win32.
    - bugfixes from Stan Tobias:
        * memory corruption error with caching system
        * case insensitivity, to match with the Windows semantics
    - modification to chm_http by Stan Tobias:
        * when the user requests the page '/', they get a page with links to
          all of the files in the archive
    - Andrew Hodgetts has ported the library to Solaris and Irix.  See README for details.
    - Stuart Caie has granted permission to relicense under the LGPL.
