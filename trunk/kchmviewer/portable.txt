It is possible to make kchmviewer a portable app, meaning it would keep its files in predefined location and will not write into system/user folders.

To do this, please create a directory named "portable" (without quotes) in the same directory where kchmviewer binary is stored. If this directory exists:

- Subdirectory "data" will be created under "portable" and will be used to store the search index and per-help file preferences;
- Application settings will be stored in subdirectory "Ulduzsoft" created in "portable"
- Qt-specific settings will be stored in "portable" directory
- Nothing will be written into any other location on disk.
